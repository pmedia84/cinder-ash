                        <p>Whatever the weather, we are keen to promote free flow learning, giving children the opportunity to choose whether they would like to be inside or outside, where provision covering all aspects of the Early Years Foundation Stage curriculum is available in both. </p><br>
                        <p>Not only do we feel this is very beneficial for learning but for health also. We are strong believers in there being no inappropriate weather, just innapropriate clothing.</p>
