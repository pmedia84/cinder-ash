We looked at several different nurseries on our hunt but Cinder Ash was the best fit for our son. The staff are extremely friendly and always make time to talk to you at drop offs and pick ups. Our son helping and promoting him to use the toilet. All in all I would recommend Cinder Ash to anyone who's looking for childcare for their child. I am extremely happy to see my child flourish into a confident and happy little boy! So thank you all at Cinder Ash.<i class="fa-solid fa-quote-right"></i></p>

We knew it was the best fit, a welcoming homely environment with genuine caring staff. Now he doesn't have to go, we send him through choice as he loves his keyworker and all the staff. As a boisterous toddler it is still the right environment allowing him to explore and engage with lots of experiences, plus being free to play outside as much as possible. We love how cinder ash has grown with him.<i class="fa-solid fa-quote-right"></i></p>

We were worried about her starting Pre School but needn't have been. She absolutely loves it and the first thing she says when she wakes each morning is "school day!" with the biggest of smiles. The staff take the time to know each child and their families so that everyone is comfortable; the children and the parents.<br><br> Each day we hear stories from our daughter about the fun, adventures and learning that she has experienced; reinforced by the photos and stories that are shared with us through Tapestry. Her communication skills and confidence has grown no end since attending. Cinder Ash addresses the educational needs of each child as well as their emotional and social wellbeing. Being part of the committee allows me to have an input into every aspect of her experience and I'd encourage all other parents to get involved with this great opportunity and Pre School.<i class="fa-solid fa-quote-right"></i></p>

I love the tapestry app and the staff always keep me updated with what (my child) is doing, as well as how he is eating, nappy changes etc. For me this is going above and beyond what I expected when (my child) started, and I love how I still feel involved when I am not with him <i class="fa-solid fa-quote-right"></i></p>
