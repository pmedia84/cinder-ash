                <p class="">Cinder Ash is a committee managed setting. This means a group of volunteers with a vested interest in the nursery, work in partnership with staff, to help manage the running of the setting and ensure the needs of children, staff and government requirements are being met. </p><br>
                <p>Although voluntary and informal, the committee are lifeblood to Cinder Ash, and are critical to the future of us as a nursery. Without the committee, Cinder Ash would fail to exist.</p><br>
                <p>Quite often, committee members are parents, and this is fantastic as it gives us a insight into parental views of the setting and helps us ensure any parent ideas can be considered and possibly incorporated. However, not all committee members need to be current parents, and those with a vested interest are welcome to join us.</p><br>
                <p>If you would like to join the committee, please speak to a member of staff or one of the current committee members, who can explain the process to you. If you would like to gain more insight into what it involves, please keep an eye on our facebook page for upcoming committee meeting dates, and come along and join us! </p>
