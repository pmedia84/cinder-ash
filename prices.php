                <p>At Cinder Ash we accept all EYE funding. On top of this, additional hours and snack will be charged as additional extras. The table below displays all additional extras and the cost of these.</p>
                <h3>Free entitlement hours xxx hours per week</h3>
                <p> For families in receipt of additional support, this equates to 15 hours per week term time only, or 12 hours per week spread across 47.5 weeks of the year from the term after your child's 2nd birthday.</p>
                <p>For those families meeting the working families criteria this is 30 hours per week term time only, or 24 hours per week stretched across 47.5 weeks of the year from the term after your child turns 9 months.</p>
                <p class="mb-2">For those families which meet neither of the criteria above, universal funding is available to all children the term after they turn 3, and this is for 15 hours term time only, or 12 ours spread across 47.5 weeks of the year.</p>

                            Snack is invoiced once a term at a cost of £5 per term for those accessing 2.5 sessions or less a term, and £10 for those accessing more than 2.5.

                <h3>Consumables (for example, nappies and sun cream)</h3>
                <p>Nappies, wipes, suncream and wellies are all to be supplied by the parents.</p>
                <p>Therefore there are no charges for consumables.</p>
                <h4>Additional voluntary services</h4>
                <p>(for example, trips, forest school sessions or foreign language lessons)
                </p>
                <p> We currently fund music man sessions from our own budget and will inform parents if we are ever are unable to do this.</p>
                <h3>Additional Information</h3>
                <p class="mb-2">Tax Free Childcare or Universal Credit Childcare can both be accessed here. We invoice as standard, and then parents can use the relevant portals to then send the money across to the setting. </p>
                <p>If you do not wish to pay for specific consumables, for example because you wish to provide your own, please make us aware so next steps can be discussed.</p>
